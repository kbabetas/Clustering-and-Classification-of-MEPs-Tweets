# Clustering-and-Classification-of-MEPs-Tweets
Clustering and Classification of MEPs' Tweets with Pandas and scikit-learn

This repository will serve as a place where the project from the course **Applied Machine Learning** will be uploaded. The course is part of the curriculum of the Department of Management Science and Technology from the Athens University of Economics and Business and the project is assigned by [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas).

## Dataset

The data that we will be using can be found here: [Tweets by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)](https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1071.

The following project assumes that the data will reside in the same directory as this notebook.

## Assignment

The Assignment Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/kbabetas/Clustering-and-Classification-of-MEPs-Tweets/blob/master/Assignment%20Instructions/twitter_meps.ipynb).

The focus of the project was to first cluster the tweets based on their text and then train some algorithms to learn to classify an unseen tweet.
